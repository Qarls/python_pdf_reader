# A command line Python OCR tool (discontinued)

 The tool uses Tesseract OCR via PyTesseract.

If Tesseract OCR is not present, an installer will run (Windows-only for now)

## This is a work in progress.

The end goal is adding a parser to categorize documents based on keywords as well as a database.
